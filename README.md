> Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed
into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts
invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world
history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths,
the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such
a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how
shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within
nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist.


Instead of the, engineering, conventional quantitative benchmarking, let's do a qualitative comparison.
